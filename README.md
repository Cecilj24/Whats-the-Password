# Password Generator Starter Code
# <WHATS-THE-PASSWORD>

## Description

This project is a password generator that I had to adjust in order for it to function correctly. Different functions, arrays and commands were added to insure that it generated a random password and worked the way it was supposed to. The project passed all checks and met all requirements in the HTML and in the console log.
